# Fundamental-Level

The course Object-Oriented Programming learned me the principles of OOP, how to work with classes and objects, 
how to use Object-Oriented modelling, and develop class hierarchies. 
I learned the basic principles of OOP as abstraction (Interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
I looked at paradigms such as event-driven programming, functional programming (lambda functions, closures and LINQ), exception handling.
